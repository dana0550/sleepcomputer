# [F-006] Signed Release and Notarization

## Summary

Produce distributable macOS builds through a signed, notarized, and checksumed release pipeline with local and CI execution paths.

## Goals

- Ensure release artifacts are signed and notarized before distribution.
- Keep local and CI release flows aligned.
- Preserve code-signing team identity required by privileged XPC trust checks.

## Non-Goals

- Auto-updater delivery channel.
- Windows/Linux packaging.

## Requirements

- R1: Local release flow must archive, sign, notarize, staple, and zip the app with SHA-256 output.
- R2: CI release flow must run equivalent signing/notarization steps on version tags.
- R3: Both local and CI flows must inject `AWAKEBAR_TEAM_ID` from Apple team identity.
- R4: Release outputs must be publishable artifacts (`.zip` + `.sha256`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Local release script exits early when required secrets are missing.
- AC2: CI workflow publishes stapled ZIP + checksum on `v*` tags.
- AC3: Team-bound signing identity is propagated to app/helper builds.

- `.github/workflows/release-macos.yml`

## Impact

<!-- AUTOGEN:IMPACT_MAP -->
- Governs trust chain for shipping privileged helper-enabled builds.
- Ensures release artifacts are reproducible and verifiable.

## Security

<!-- AUTOGEN:SECURITY_CHECKLIST -->
- [x] Uses Apple notarization and Developer ID signing
- [x] Requires explicit secrets for signing credentials
- [x] Preserves team ID consistency for XPC code-sign checks

## Budget

<!-- AUTOGEN:BUDGET_CHECKLIST -->
- [x] CI cost bounded to tag-triggered release builds
- [x] Local release script is single-pass and deterministic per input
