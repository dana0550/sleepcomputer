# [F-004.04] Lock on Lid Close

## Summary

Provide an optional menu setting that locks the computer on lid-close events while `Full Awake` is actively ON.

## Goals

- Add an explicit user-controlled lock-on-lid-close setting.
- Keep lock behavior gated to active Full Awake sessions.
- Preserve deterministic behavior across macOS variants by explicitly surfacing unsupported lock capability.

## Non-Goals

- Locking when Full Awake is OFF.
- Expanding privileged helper command surface for locking.
- Guaranteeing one specific hard-lock binary on every macOS build.

## Requirements

- R1: Menu must expose `Lock Computer on Lid Close` in inline `Settings` only when lid-state hardware support is available.
- R2: Lock-on-lid-close execution must require all gates: setting enabled, `Full Awake` ON, lid support available, and lock capability supported.
- R3: Lid-close handling must be edge-based and trigger a single lock attempt per close cycle.
- R4: Lock attempts must use verifiable lock commands only (`CGSession -suspend` path set) and succeed only when session lock state verifies true within a bounded window.
- R5: If no verifiable lock command is available on the current macOS build, lock capability must be reported unsupported and lock preference must not be enabled.
- R6: Lock failures must surface as transient menu errors and must not mutate runtime Full Awake state flags.
- R7: Command execution and lock-state verification must both use bounded timeouts; lock path must never hang indefinitely.
- R8: Lock orchestration must be transition-safe: monitoring is disabled while `Full Awake` transitions OFF, and queued close events must re-check gates before locking.
- R9: Lock attempts must be single-flight; close-edge events that arrive while a lock attempt is in flight must not run parallel lock commands.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: With all gates true and capability supported, one close cycle triggers one lock attempt; repeated close notifications without reopen do not double-trigger.
- AC2: With Full Awake OFF, lid-close events do not trigger lock attempts.
- AC3: With lock preference OFF, lid-close events do not trigger lock attempts.
- AC4: Lock-on-lid-close preference persists across relaunch with default OFF for fresh installs.
- AC5: If a lid-close event is queued but `Full Awake` turns OFF before execution, no lock command runs.
- AC6: Rapid close-edge events while a lock attempt is running do not execute parallel lock commands.
- AC7: If a command exits or times out without verifiable locked session state, fallback progression continues and returns promptly.
- AC8: When lock capability is unsupported, the toggle is disabled with an explicit reason and persisted ON preference is normalized to OFF on bootstrap.

## API Contract

<!-- AUTOGEN:API_CONTRACT_SUMMARY -->
- `LidStateMonitoring`
- `ComputerLockControlling`
- `ComputerLockCapability`
- `MenuBarController.setLockOnLidCloseEnabled(_:)`
- `MenuBarController.lockOnLidCloseCapability`
- `AppState.lockOnLidCloseEnabled`

## Impact

<!-- AUTOGEN:IMPACT_MAP -->
- Adds optional safety lock behavior for closed-lid Full Awake sessions when verifiable lock capability is available.
- Prevents false-positive lock status by requiring lock-state verification and explicit unsupported UI messaging when unavailable.

## Security

<!-- AUTOGEN:SECURITY_CHECKLIST -->
- [x] No credential storage or credential prompts
- [x] No privileged helper command expansion for lock flow
- [x] Fails safely with transient messaging when lock command chain fails or cannot verify lock state

## Budget

<!-- AUTOGEN:BUDGET_CHECKLIST -->
- [x] Event-driven monitor lifecycle gated by active Full Awake + preference + lock capability support
- [x] No continuous polling loop

## Changelog

- 2026-02-20: Initial child spec created for lock-on-lid-close behavior and gating model.
- 2026-02-20: Added non-blocking lock fallback, transition-safe gate re-checking, and single-flight lock requirements with direct regression coverage.
- 2026-02-21: Replaced best-effort fallback semantics with strict lock-state verification and explicit unsupported-capability handling.
