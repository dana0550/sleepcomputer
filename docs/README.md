# AwakeBar Documentation

This directory follows a Markdown-only specification system.

- `FEATURES.md` is the source of truth for feature IDs, names, status, and hierarchy.
- `features/` contains per-feature implementation and acceptance specs.
- `PRODUCT_MAP.md` is a rendered hierarchy from `FEATURES.md`.
- `MASTER_SPEC.md` captures product-level constraints and release scope.
